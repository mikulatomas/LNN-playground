# LNN-playground

Repository of jupyter notebooks with examples of [Logical Neural Networks (LNN)](https://github.com/IBM/LNN) by IBM.

Beware, errors are probably included, I am also learning :)

## Reasoning
* `01_foursides.ipynb` - simple example of reasoning with rectangles and squares
* `02_geometry.ipynb` to `06_geometry.ipynb` - bigger set of examples which uses quadrilateral hierarchy and reasoning above it

## Learning
* `01_training_example.ipynb` - simple demonstration of learning
* `typicality.ipynb` - typicality example (work in progress, not working)
